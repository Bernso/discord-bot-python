# Discord bot
This bot is just a personal project of mine, I have gotten sxternal help as I am self taught when it comes to the discord liabry in python, I have tried to use javascript to code a discord bot, but it did not end well becasuse I did not know the language and I am in the process of learning the language (I think).
# Random python files
If you see any out of place python files, they are most likely the files i added so that the user can run them through my bot.
# Things you may need to change
- Server ID's
- Channel ID's
- Role ID's
- User ID's
<p>Because of all of this (i reccomend) you should create your own .env file to keep all of your data safe, especially your token.</p>
